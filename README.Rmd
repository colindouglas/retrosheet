Import Retrosheet data as a structured R object
`retrosheet` is an R package that downloads and parses the single-season event, gamelog, roster, and schedule
files from http://www.retrosheet.org into structured R objects for further analysis.

**Note:** As of retrosheet 1.1.0, this repo contains the version available on CRAN. Older versions can be found [here](https://github.com/rmscriven/retrosheet).

## Installation
`retrosheet` can be installed from CRAN, or development versions installed from Github.
```r
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("retrosheet")

# Install development version from Github
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("colindouglas/retrosheet")
```

## Usage
* `getRetrosheet()` - This workhorse function returns the full seasonal data associated with the user-entered 
 arguments
    * Use the `cache` argument to save a local cache and avoid stressing retrosheet.org
    * Use `get_retrosheet()` as a drop-in replacement to return tibbles instead of matrices
* `getPartialGamelog()` - An alternative to returning the full gamelog files.  This function allows the user
 to choose the columns and date. Column names are made available by the global object `gamelogFields`
 
Also included are convenience functions 

* `getFileNames()` - for obtaining a list of all zip files currently available for use by this package
* `getTeamIDs()` - for providing the team ID value to be used in the `team` argument of `getRetrosheet()`
* `getParkIDs()` - for ballpark ID and name information
